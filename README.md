# Battleship Project using TDD with Jest

- Layed out using Excalidraw to formulate Class structure and properties
- Using Jest and TDD practices to build out Gameboard, Ship, and Player functionality
- Built using Webpack, Jest, Tailwind, and JavaScript

## Features to implement
- Smarter AI attacks, having follow up hits placed adjacent if previous attack was a hit
- Generate ships button needs to randomize locations / Currently only page reloads do this
- Seperate logic into separate modules and have everything run into one file through a main function

- UI Design needs to be more fleshed out

## Things I learned
- Learned how to use TDD to build out complex logic.
- Worked on laying out the entire project using Excalidraw before commiting any lines of code
- Learned how to setup Webpack with Tailwind, ESLint, and Prettie support

### Tech Stack Used
- Jest
- Webpack / Webpack Dev Server
- ESLint
- Prettier
- HTML, Tailwind, & JavaScript
